# AdobeAtAdobe's docker 6.1 base image
This is based on this repo example https://github.com/sergeimuller/aem-base and https://hub.docker.com/u/ggotti/

This Docker image contains common functionality for installing [Adobe Experience Manager 6.1](http://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-1.html).

Building localy from project directory issue the following command
docker build -t aem_6-1_base .

or if you want to you can go to the composedev-tar folder and I have put in a little script that pulls all the repos and builds it all localy for you.
